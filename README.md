# Carbon Emissions and Economic success

## Individual Assessment created for International Baccalaureate Environmental Systems and Societies Standard Level class

Evaluated the relationships between carbon emissions and economic success, as measured by GDP per capita and unemployment rate. Used tidyverse, R, and Quarto to complete analysis. The analysis found that in low-GDP countries, GDP per capita and carbon emissions had a positive correlation, while in high-GDP countries, GDP per capita and carbon emissions had a negative correlation, or in other words, in high-GDP countries, as carbon emissions increased, GDP per capita decreased. In all countries, unemployment was not strongly correlated with carbon emissions. The author concluded that high-GDP countries have a responsibility to decrease carbon emissions so that the world can continue developing, and that doing so will not harm their economies.
